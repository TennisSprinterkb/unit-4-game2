    <p>
            You will be given a random speed(number) at the start of the game.

            There are four vehicles below. By clicking on a vehicle, you will add a specific speed to your total speed(score).
            
            You win the game by matching your speed to the Speed limit sign. You lose the game if your speed goes above the speed sign.
            
            How much speed each car contains is hidden from you until you click on it.
            
            Each time when the game starts, the game will change the speed of each vehicle.
